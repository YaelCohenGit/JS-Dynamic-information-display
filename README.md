# JS Dynamic Information Display

This project demonstrates how to dynamically display and update information on a webpage using JavaScript. It allows users to interact with the page and see real-time changes based on their input. The data is saved and retrieved using JSON for persistent storage.

## Features

- Display dynamic content based on user input.
- Update content without reloading the page.
- Save and load data using JSON.
- Interact with elements using buttons, forms, and input fields.
- Use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS** - Styles the webpage and the dynamic elements.
- **JavaScript** - Handles the dynamic updates, interaction logic, and data manipulation.
- **JSON** - Used to store and retrieve data.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Interact with the input fields and buttons to dynamically update the content on the page.
3. The content will change based on the actions you perform, and the data will be saved in JSON format for future use.
